This is a quick project i worked on to get familiarized with coding C++ in unreal engine.

It's a simple voxel terrain generator that generates a noise texture, interprets it as a heightmap, and uses that heightmap to calculate the block data. Then it generates the faces of the blocks using a greedy meshing algorithm.
